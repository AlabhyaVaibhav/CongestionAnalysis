# CongestionAnalysis
This study develops a model and methodology to estimate the congestion costs, in order to levy an optimal charge. Three major congestion costs are analysed in this paper â€“ value of time cost, fuel cost and pollution cost, all of which are responsible for cost. Using the estimated congestion cost, we plan to recommend the same to the transport department to help alleviate the congestion on the roads of the national capital. The same study can be further used to identify the cost for all the cities in the country and thus make India a less congested, and a more green nation.
